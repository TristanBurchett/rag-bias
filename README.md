This is an analysis of social biases in RAG (retrieval-augmented generation).
RAG is a technique for implementing search via large language model embeddings.
The analysis uses the GrepBiasIR dataset ("Gender REPresentation Bias for Information Retrieval")
A repository contains a copy of the original GrepBiasIR dataset, as well as precomputed embeddings for all the documents in that dataset, using various embedding models.
To use the precomputed embeddings, you will need to uncompress embeddings.zip.
To regenerate the embeddings for yourself, you will need to provide your API keys for various embedding providers (e.g. OpenAI and Google)
